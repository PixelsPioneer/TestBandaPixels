Product Scraping API
This API is designed to connect to various online stores and scrape product details.

Technological Stack
The API is developed using TypeScript and integrates several libraries and tools, such as:

TypeORM for database interaction
dotenv for environment variable management
nodemon for auto-reloading during development
Express for building the REST API
React for the frontend
Axios for HTTP requests
Cheerio for scraping HTML data
Puppeteer for interacting with dynamic pages
MySQL as the database
Docker for containerization
Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Choosing the Deployment Environment
You will need to decide where you want to deploy the API. There are two options available:

Local Setup
If you choose to run the API on your local machine, follow these steps:

Create a .env file by copying .env.example.

Configure the database connection details in the .env file:

env
Copy code
PORT=5000

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=user
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=mydatabase
Docker Setup
If you prefer to deploy the API using Docker, you can use the .env.docker file and run the following command to build and start the containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
This will build and launch the API in a Docker container.

Populating the Database with Product Data
To populate the database with product information, you need to send POST requests to the scraping endpoints. Use tools like Postman or any other HTTP request tool to interact with the API.

Scraping Products from Telemart
Send a POST request to the following endpoint:

text
Copy code
http://localhost:5000/api/telemart
This endpoint will scrape and save information about about pc from Telemart.

Scraping Products from Telemart
To scrape product details from Telemart, use this endpoint:

text
Copy code
http://localhost:5000/api/rozetka
This will fetch and store information about pc from Rozetka.

Scraping Products from Rozetka
To scrape product details from Rozetka, use this endpoint:

text
Copy code
http://localhost:5000/api/scrape
This endpoint will scrape and save information about pc from Rozetka and Telemart.

Scraping Products from Rozetka and Telemart
To scrape product details from Rozetka and Telemart, use this endpoint:

After executing these requests, your database will be populated with the product data, and you can proceed to display the product list.

Accessing the Frontend Application
Once the Docker build process is complete, you will see the following message in your terminal:

text
Copy code
You can now view the frontend in the browser.
frontend-1  |
frontend-1  |   Local:            http://localhost:3000
frontend-1  |   On Your Network:  *********************
This means the frontend application is running and can be accessed at the provided URLs.

Local: This URL allows you to view the application on the machine where Docker is running.
On Your Network: This URL lets other devices on the same network access the application.
Simply open a browser and navigate to either URL to start interacting with the frontend application.

Accessing Swagger API Documentation
The Swagger UI provides an interactive interface for exploring and testing the API. It allows you to view all available endpoints, understand their parameters, and make requests directly from the UI.

To access the Swagger documentation for this project, follow these steps:

Ensure that the server is running. If you are using Docker, confirm that the frontend and backend containers are up and running.
Open a browser and navigate to the following URL:
text
Copy code
http://localhost:5000/api-docs
This will load the Swagger UI, where you can explore the available API endpoints and try out different operations.

What You Can Do with Swagger:
Browse Available Endpoints: You can see all the available API endpoints with their respective methods (GET, POST, etc.).
View Parameters and Responses: Each endpoint displays information about the parameters it accepts and the responses it returns, including example responses.
Make Test Requests: You can directly test the API by sending requests (e.g., GET, POST) through the Swagger UI. It will show the response in real-time, making it easy to test the functionality of the API.
